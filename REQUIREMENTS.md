1. We need a landing page, where the customer will purchase a consultation. When purchasing the appointment, you are redirected to a virtual queue where your current position in the queue is shown.
2. In the system background, the queue is shown in order of arrival. The doctor who is available to assist will call the next person in line.
3. When calling the next person in line, a field is shown with all the customer's registered personal information. With a side button to start the video call via Google Meet within the system page itself.
4. When clicking on the start call button, the patient's medical record form must also be opened to enter the consultation data and procedures.
5. After the call starts, the doctor will also have a side button to prescribe medications and documents for the patient. (Integrate via the Meumed or Mevo api) It must also be opened in the service window itself.
6. At the end of the consultation, there should be three statuses for the doctor to select: Completed, Technical Problem, No Answer
